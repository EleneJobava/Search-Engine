• 18:00–19:00: Did overall review of the assignment and analyzed the Json data structure, created project files
and folders. Confused about how combining name + description for search will work and whether they should be weighted
equally. No changes yet, still in planning phase.

• 19:00–20:00: Researched ranking approaches for search. Compared BM25 and sentence transformer based semantic search.
Was unsure whether BM25 alone would handle intent queries like "gift for kids" where no exact words match.
Decided to use both BM25 and semantic search combined into a hybrid score.
Implemented input preprocessing (lowercasing, removing special characters, trimming extra spaces).

• 21:00–22:00: Tried to understand how the semantic search actually works under the hood. Learned that embeddings are
just coordinates in high dimensional space where similar meanings land close together, even though they may not share
same letters. Once i understood embeddings cosine similarity followed naturally you are just measuring the angle
between two vectors. So with hybrid search BM25 will catch exact keyword matches, while semantic search will catch
meaning-based matches that share no words. Better to use together as BM25 wins on precise queries, semantics wins on
vague queries and can actually be worse at exact keyword matching. No changes made to the code.
